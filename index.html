                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am from Cleveland Heights Ohio and am a current student at the University of Michigan Engineering College.
                    I am a current Junior who is studying computer science. Originally, I wanted to attend the University of Michigan mainly for the quality of education;
                    however, I was unsure what path this choice would lead me too. Shortly after I arrived at michigan I quickly fell 
                    in love with the world of coding. Aside from my education, I am also a multisport athlete that enjoys being outside.
                    I was a big runner in highschool and I have continued throughout college. I also will play anyone in a game in basketball given
                    the oppertunity.
