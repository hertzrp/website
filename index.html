                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Welcome! My name Is Ryan Hertz, and I am an Engineering student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I will be graduating with my bachelors degree in Computer Science in May of 2021.</p>

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am from Cleveland Heights Ohio and am a current student at the University of Michigan Engineering College.
                    I am a current Junior who is studying computer science. Originally, I wanted to attend the University of Michigan mainly for the quality of education;
                    however, I was unsure what path this choice would lead me too. Shortly after I arrived at michigan I quickly fell 
                    in love with the world of coding. Aside from my education, I am also a multisport athlete that enjoys being outside.
                    I was a big runner in highschool and I have continued throughout college. I also will play anyone in a game in basketball given
                    the oppertunity.

                    <p>I have been able to work on my own projects as well as many additional projects throughout my classes at Michigan. Here are just a few of them!</p>

                        Creating this website was a self project that I really wanted to learn. I managed to teach myself HTML 
                        and code this webpage from scratch. This project has helped me to learn how to code in HTML as well with 
                        working with DNS setup and redirection and site management.</p>
